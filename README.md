# Create Your Custom Object Detection Model for Keras.
<p>Your work is just to Download the dataset of the categories you want to detect and that's it.</p>

#### This Project Uses <a href='https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet'>Darknet</a> for training and is highly inspired from <a href='https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3'>Experiencor's project</a> For implementing Object Detection.

## Downloading Dataset:
<p>First thing to implement an object detection is to download dataset. And downloading dataset is extremely easy.</p><br />
<p>Dataset will be downloaded from <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html'>Google's Open Image Dataset</a> which have wide variety of images available openly for sake of research and development</p>
